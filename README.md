# SimpleMultiTenant
A simple multi-tenant app with starting code from: [Michael Mckenna's blog](https://michael-mckenna.com/multi-tenant-asp-dot-net-core-application-tenant-resolution/) His Github is [here](https://github.com/myquay)

## The Simple most recent way to do Multitenancy:
The tenant is resolved by the first path route parameter.
```
HttpContext.Request.Path.Value.Split('/')[1];
```

So the tenant is Mapped in startup like this:
```
endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    pattern: "{tenant}/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
```

You will need to add the tenant name for javascript http requests so in Javascript you can get the tenant with this:
```
tenantName: '/' + window.location.pathname.split('/')[1]
```

On Controllers which have an [ApiController] attribute it will also need a route attribute with the tenant.
```
[ApiController]
[Route("{tenant}/[controller]")]
```

You have to change the scaffolded Identity UI to get Identity to work with each tenant. Like suggested in the top answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50682108/change-routing-in-asp-net-core-identity-ui)

Instead of adding AddDefaultIdentity(), the AddIdentity() should be added in Configure services.

AddIdentity Example:
```
 services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>(options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = false)
                .AddSignInManager()
                .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()
                .AddDefaultTokenProviders();
```

In my production project I changed the scaffolded Identity UI Pages into a MVC version. The login and register doesn't work. I am guessing because of the cookes for each tenant needs to be configured.

If you get an ANCM Multiple In-Process Applications in same Process Error when using different tenant than the default tenant then delete the .vs folder in the folder near your sln file like it says [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246822/http-error-500-35-ancm-multiple-in-process-applications-in-same-process-asp-ne)

[This](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/multitenant-identity/) explains how to do identity in multitenant applications.
